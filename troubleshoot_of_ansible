if not able to ping with ansible without --ask-pass

first install sshpass with 'apt-get install' sshpass and then check
make sure the line is Uncomment 'host_key_checking = False' at /etc/ansible.conf
Then make sure in sshd_config which is at /etc/ssh/ the line is set 'PasswordAuthentication yes'  and then run the ssh service
now try with  ansible_pass instead of ansible_ssh_pass
